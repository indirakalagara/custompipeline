# The responsibility of this pipeline is to package kabanero pipelines,
# release them to github and create and update the kabanero custom resource to
# point to x release.

# The only constant is change.
# Pipelines will grow and change over time and hence we need a place to version
# control pipelines.

# e.g
# xyz-pipeline grows over time and exists in the xyz-pipeline github repo
# you would then use this pipeline in the kabanero namespace and create a web-
# hook for the xyz-pipeline repo and use the package-release-update-pl pipeline
# to deploy your xyz-pipeline repo to kabanero
